            <h3>How do I report or get information on a claim?</h3>
            <p>To report a claim: <a href="#">Log in to your policy</a> or call 04 236 4000
            If you paid your bill in full directly and need to request a reimbursement, you will need to complete a claim form
            and mail it to us with a copy of your itemized medical bill and any additional supporting documentation requested.
            If you see an in-network provider, your healthcare provider or pharmacy will bill your insurance company directly.
            In this case, you will not have to file a claim yourself.</p>

            <h3>How long does the application approval process take? How can I track the status of my application?</h3>
            <p>It usually takes about two weeks for your application to be processed and approved by the insurance company
after submitting your application online. You’ll get an email from us once your application has been approved to
make the payment and receive your policy.</p>

            <h3>Can an insurance company reject my application? For what reasons?</h3>
            <p>The main reasons an insurance company would deny your application is if you provide fraudulent or incomplete
information on your application. An insurance company will not reject your application as a result of any
preexisting health condition, and they will not reject you as a result of any health information you provide to us.</p>

            <h3>I want to renew my policy for another year. Why did my premium rate change?</h3>
            <p>When you purchase insurance, your pricing is set for the current year. Once your policy expires at the end of the year, you have the option of renewing your plan to extend your coverage for another year, or to look for different
plans or new options that have come on the market.</p>
        <p>We’ll always look around for better rates for you, because sometimes carriers raise their premiums based on
several factors. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your insurance history (like lapses in coverage or a claim)</li>
                <li>The type of car you drive</li>
                <li>Your coverages and deductibles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The best way to understand a rate change is to call us at 04 236 4000.</p>

            <h3>I don’t know what these insurance terms mean. What is a “deductible”?</h3>
            <p>We know these terms are pretty technical and hard to get, so we’ve put together an <a href="#">Insurance Terms guide</a> to help define some of these confusing terms in plain English.</p>
            <p>A <strong>“deductible”</strong> is the amount you spend before insurance pays most or all of your bills. You will pay most medical costs until your deductible is reached, except for "preventative" visits for which many health plans will pay for in full.</p>
